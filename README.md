# TU-Restaurants
<h1>Taif University Restaurants</h1>
The problem: Due to a shortage of time between classes, picking the 
correct place to eat from the university's restaurants and knowing their 
menu and costs might be a distraction.
The solution: We give the names of all restaurants, along with menus, 
pricing, and locations, on our website to make it easier to find the 
closest restaurant and to reduce the time spent thinking about what to 
eat and how much to spend. All university employees and students have 
access to this website.
